// Qs1. Write a JS program to delete all occurrences of element num in a given array. Example: if arr=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3] & num=2, the result should be arr=[1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 3].

// Qs2. Write a JS program to find the number of digits in a number. Example: if number=287152, count=6.

// Qs3. Write a JS program to find the sum of digits in a number. Example: if number=287152, sum=25.

// Qs4. Print the factorial of a number n. [Factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to a given positive integer and denoted by that integer.] 
// Example:
// 7! (factorial of 7) = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 = 5040
// 5! (factorial of 5) = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 = 120
// 3! (factorial of 3) = 1 x 2 x 3 = 6
// 0! is always 1

// Qs5. Find the largest number in an array with only positive numbers.
